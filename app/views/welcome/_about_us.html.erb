<h1 class="styled-header" class="text-center">Welcome to <span class="red">Heat</span> <span class="blue">Seek</span> <span class="light-blue">NYC</span></h1>
<p class="lead"><b>We</b> created <span class="red">Heat</span> <span class="blue">Seek</span> <span class="light-blue">NYC</span> to address the need of adequate heating for low income tenants in NYC. Unfortunately, landlords will commonly lower the heating in their buildings to inhospitable levels in attempts to save money on heating, or to drive out poorer tenants to raise the rents.  This has serious impacts on the people living inside such buildings, range from deciding whether to eat this week or heat their apartment with expensive, dangerous space-heaters, to an increase likely hood of illness and death.</p>

<p class="lead"><b>We</b> designed <span class="red">Heat</span> <span class="blue">Seek</span> <span class="light-blue">NYC</span> to help validate tenants claims against their landlords.  We use the Internet of things to record the temperature of apartments and remotely send them back to us.  Combined with real time measurements of the outside temperature, we create a record of every hour that the user's apartment's temperature is below the legal minimum.  By moving the burden of evidence off a tenant to a third party we hope to remove ambiguity from a court case that can be tinged with speculative evidence.</p>

<p class="lead"><b><span class="red">Heat</span> <span class="blue">Seek</span> <span class="light-blue">NYC</span></b> thanks its three real world users that allowed us to collect data from their apartments for our proof of concept.</p>
